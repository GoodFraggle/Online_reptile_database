								<h2>The big picture.</h2>
								<p>I have been breeding snakes and other animals for over 30 years, animal keepers and pet oner's spend a lot of money and time on there pets. As people treat pets like spoiled children, this often leads people to be unaware of the fact they are doing this.</p>

								<p>If we built a simple to use animal database linked to an app, website plus social media platforms. People can add there animals feeding schedule, growth rates, exercise plans, size and weight, etc. By logging all the data we can deduce the perfect requirements for any given species.</p>
								<p>Another use for the data would be for vets to have a there local vet to have a "vet user level" so they can check this important data to help conclude the problem with the health of the animal.</p>

								<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/463662/pet-care-market-value-in-the-united-kingdom-by-category/"> Pet care market value in the United Kingdom (UK) 2019</a>

								<p>The data could lead to major scientific discoverys as the database grows with never seen before data, recorded by every one and professionals alike.</p>

								<p>Breeders could be the largest group of data collecters. As a breeder myself i have to keep records anyway, my collection of animals somtimes are in the 100's and used to be 1000's so keeping health and feeding records is a must (These records are on paper and rarely continues to be kept after buyers collect the animal.). Animal records are also kept by pet shops and farmers. When selling an animal, the records of that animal is passed to the customer along with photo's of the animal from birth and a home made pedigree. The pedigree is important as poor quality aniamls are common and people know to look for this when spending $1000's on a new pet.</p>

								<p>Getting pet owners to add the pet info could be a challange. People can be encouraged by building a reward system. Creating a social media platform with nice pet photo's and building relationships based on pets not friends. Of course making everything easy to use is the key to user's using anything.</p>

								<p>A animal market is also a great way to link everything together, being able to sell the right animal to the right person is something the internet is great for. Before i sold to pet shops who then sell to the customer, by missing out the shops then we can keep track and log that info too.</p>
								<a href="https://www.morphmarket.com/us/">
								This is a live reptile market, not the only one but the one to beat!</a>
								<p>There is data we should display that would not be collected by the means mentioned above. This would be basic species info. Data like wild habitate info, basic size and weight, diet requierments etc, country of oragin. This extra info could be pulled from other websites via spiderbot's but a lot can be added by everyone and encouraged with incentives like a built in rankand reward system and access to other parts of the site, simular to forums having moderator's and admin's. Volinteers should be used where possible to verifying other input's into the database. Possibly having a middle stage for info that needs checking before adding?</p>

								<p>As new data is being constantly being added, the old data is changing and being updated.</p>

								<p>A large problem i have faced in my limited experance of programming is the fact that there is always a exception to the rule! This has caused me to go round in circles many times, even a simple field on a form or cell in a table is not simple when dealing with live animals. For example but not limited to:</p>
									<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
										<li>The animal's sex can be "not known" or a male that has changed to female for real or by a mistake.</li>
										<li>The animal is red in colour, Nope it can come in any colour or pattern <a href="http://reptile.guide/ball-python-morphs/">info showing some info of the different varieties of a single animal.</a> </li>
										<li>Some animals only have one sex.</li>
										<li>Even the animal names is a mess. A single species of animal can have many names and trhe latin name can change also.</li>
										<li>A snake can be venomous then have it's venom capability's removed then it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venomoid">venomoid</a></li>
									</ul>

								<h2>First step</h2>

								<p>I think the first step should be to start with a single genus, Reptiles, I know this the best, it probaly also has the most verities so the solutions should be just be a matter of "copy and paste" hopfully :)</p>

								<p>By starting with a market/selling platform and getting the backing and recommendation of the breeders. We could ask them recommend us to the customers to keep unsing our platform, the breeder has a added benifit that he could get feed back from the animal for the rest of it's life. The breeder seeing the info of all there animals through out there whole lives he could see if he is breeding bad blood lines and what happens to the animals as they might get passed on from one owner to another, with every owner being able to carry on the records.</p>

								<p>The second step would be a forum and file sharing platform, people can share there cute images and pet activity's for the day, with other users of the same animal type, the Breeder and maybe a Vet being linked in to the comment about that animal.</p>

								<h2>Long term goal</h2>

								<p>In the end i hope to have the worlds biggest animal database linked to a pet/animal based platform that can dominate corner of the industry online.</p>

								<p>With a database full of accurate animal and user data, constantly being checked and updated by users. A platform regulated by moderators and admins will leave us to update and manage the whole thing.</p>

								<p>Data of this type (isn't as far as i know) is not being collected in this way. leaving us free to corner the market and do what we want.</p>

								<h2>Money</h2>

								<p>Although money isn't my first reason to do all this (i have been thinking, dreaming and planing this for years, purely from a "love of animals" point of view)
								it is obvious there will be plenty of money to be earned here plus this is a lot of work, so this should be rewarded with a financial benefit :)</p>

								<p>There is money in data, this is how the richest companys work like Google, Facebook etc. Plus there is advertising, product sells etc. at no point should anyone be charged to use any of our product, this should keep everyone using it and keep updating everything to.</p>
